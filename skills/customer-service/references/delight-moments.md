# Delight Moments Playbook

Systematic approach to creating memorable customer experiences.

---

## The Philosophy

**Delight ≠ Over-promising.** It's doing the expected thing exceptionally well, then adding one unexpected element.

**Delight at scale:** Not every interaction needs to be 10/10. Focus on high-impact moments.

## Delight Triggers

### High-Value Moments (Always Consider Delight)

| Trigger | Why It Matters | Delight Action |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| First interaction | Sets expectations for relationship | Extra warmth, proactive help |
| After extended issue | Trust needs rebuilding | Tangible gesture + follow-up |
| Milestone reached | Celebration opportunity | Acknowledge achievement |
| Provided helpful feedback | They invested effort | Recognition + show impact |
| Returning after absence | Win-back opportunity | Welcome back, special offer |
| Referral source | They vouched for us | Thank them explicitly |

### Context Signals

**Look for:**
- Mentions of deadlines or pressure
- Multiple previous tickets
- Long tenure as customer
- Specific use case details (shows engagement)
- Positive language despite issue
- Community involvement

**Example recognition:**
```
I noticed you've been with us since 2023 and this is your first support ticket - thanks for giving us a shot all this time!
```

## Anti-Patterns

### Don't Over-Delight
- Don't promise what you can't consistently deliver
- Don't set expectations for every interaction to be extraordinary
- Don't be so friendly it feels fake

### Avoid Hollow Gestures
❌ "As a token of our appreciation..." (without substance)
❌ Generic gift that shows no thought
❌ Upgrade they didn't want or need

### Watch for Manipulation
- Customer demands gestures as expectation
- Pattern of creating issues for compensation
- Escalate to human judgment

---

## Measuring Delight

### Signals It Worked
- Customer explicitly thanks you
- Customer mentions specific element
- Customer shares positive feedback
- Customer continues engagement
- No negative follow-up

### Signals to Adjust
- No response (may have overdone it)
- Awkward reception
- Request to just solve the problem
- Pattern of not resonating

## The Delight Decision Tree

```
Is this a delight-trigger situation?
├── Yes → Do I have context that makes it personal?
│   ├── Yes → Apply high-touch delight (reference context)
│   └── No → Apply standard delight (warmth + one extra)
└── No → Focus on efficient, warm resolution

Can I add one unexpected element?
├── Free action available? → Do it
├── Low-cost action appropriate? → Use judgment
├── Medium/high cost needed? → Get approval
└── Nothing fits naturally? → That's okay, solve well
```

---

## Daily Practice

**Start of shift:** Review recent tickets for delight opportunities missed
**During responses:** Ask "What's the unexpected extra I can add?"
**End of shift:** Note one delight moment that worked well

Over time, delight becomes instinct rather than checklist.
