# World-Class Service Frameworks

Proven methodologies from Disney, Ritz-Carlton, Zappos, and Apple.

## Disney: HEARD Model

For service recovery when things go wrong.

### H - Hear
Let them fully explain without interrupting. Active listening signals:
- "I understand"
- "Tell me more about what happened"
- Don't jump to solutions

### E - Empathize
Connect emotionally before solving:
- "That sounds really frustrating"
- "I'd feel the same way"
- Acknowledge the impact, not just the facts

### A - Apologize
Sincere, specific apology:
- "I'm sorry this happened" (not "I'm sorry you feel that way")
- Own it even if it wasn't your fault
- No excuses or blame

### R - Resolve
Fix it with urgency:
- Offer solution immediately
- Give options when possible
- Go beyond the minimum

### D - Diagnose
Prevent recurrence:
- Understand root cause
- Report for systemic fixes
- Follow up if relevant

**HEARD in Action:**
```
"I hear you - three days without access to your data is unacceptable. [HEAR]

That must have been incredibly stressful, especially with your deadline coming up. [EMPATHIZE]

I'm really sorry we let you down on this. [APOLOGIZE]

I've restored your access and priority-exported your last week of data - it should hit your inbox in 5 minutes. [RESOLVE]

I'm also flagging this with our team to understand why the alerts didn't trigger - we should have caught this sooner. [DIAGNOSE]"
```

## Ritz-Carlton: Gold Standards

### The Three Steps of Service

1. **Warm welcome** - Use name, acknowledge them as an individual
2. **Anticipation and fulfillment** - Predict needs, exceed expectations
3. **Fond farewell** - Personal send-off with name, invitation to return

### The $2,000 Rule
Every employee empowered to spend up to $2,000 to resolve a guest issue without approval.

**For support:** Be empowered to offer credits, extended trials, premium features, or other gestures without escalating every decision.

### Motto
"We are Ladies and Gentlemen serving Ladies and Gentlemen."

**Translation:** Treat customers as equals deserving of respect, not problems to handle.

### Key Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Ownership | "I'll take care of this" - no hand-offs |
| Anticipation | Solve the next problem before they ask |
| Unscripted excellence | Genuine, not robotic |
| Problem = opportunity | Recovery can create more loyalty than no problem |

## Zappos: WOW Culture

### Core Philosophy
Deliver WOW through service. The goal is creating emotional connections, not closing tickets.

### The No-Script Approach
- No call time limits
- No scripts to follow
- Empower reps to do what's right
- "Be yourself" - authenticity over efficiency

### 10 Core Values (Support-Relevant)

1. **Deliver WOW** - Go beyond satisfaction
2. **Be humble** - We serve, we don't know everything
3. **Embrace change** - Adapt to each customer
4. **Be adventurous** - Try new approaches
5. **Build relationships** - Not transactions
6. **Do more with less** - Creative solutions
7. **Be passionate** - Care genuinely
8. **Open and honest** - Even when it's hard
9. **Positive team spirit** - Energy is contagious
10. **Be yourself** - Authentic > scripted

### The 10-Hour Call
Zappos' famous record: a 10+ hour call with a single customer. Not efficient. Legendary.

**Lesson:** Sometimes the right answer is to spend more time, not less.

### PEC (Personal Emotional Connection)
Every interaction should have one moment of genuine human connection:
- Comment on something unique in their message
- Share something relatable
- Remember previous interactions
- Treat them as a person, not a ticket

## Apple: APPLE Protocol

### A - Approach
Warm, personalized greeting:
- "Hi [Name], thanks for reaching out"
- Match their energy level
- Set a welcoming tone

### P - Probe
Understand through questions:
- Open-ended: "Tell me more about what you're trying to do"
- Clarifying: "When you say X, do you mean...?"
- Confirming: "So if I understand correctly..."

### P - Present
Offer solutions tailored to their needs:
- Based on what you learned in Probe
- Frame benefits, not features
- Give options when appropriate

### L - Listen
Address concerns and objections:
- "I hear your concern about..."
- Validate before countering
- Adjust recommendation if needed

### E - End
Close with next steps and fond farewell:
- Clear action items
- Offer continued support
- Personal sign-off

**APPLE in Action:**
```
[APPROACH]
Hi Marcus, thanks for reaching out about this!

[PROBE]
Can you help me understand what you were trying to do when this happened? And is this affecting your main workflow or something you do occasionally?

[PRESENT - after they respond]
Based on what you've described, I think the best fix is [specific solution]. This will [benefit 1] and also [benefit 2].

[LISTEN]
I know you mentioned you'd tried something similar before without luck - this approach is different because [explain].

[END]
Give this a try and let me know how it goes. I'm here if you hit any snags!
```

## Framework Comparison

| Framework | Best For | Core Insight |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| HEARD | Service recovery, angry customers | Emotions before solutions |
| Ritz-Carlton | Premium experience, empowerment | Anticipation and ownership |
| Zappos | Building relationships, loyalty | Authenticity over efficiency |
| APPLE | Problem-solving, technical support | Structure with flexibility |

## Combining Frameworks

**For a frustrated customer with a technical issue:**

1. Start with **HEARD** - acknowledge emotions, apologize
2. Use **APPLE** probe - understand the real problem
3. Apply **Ritz-Carlton** anticipation - solve + predict next issue
4. End with **Zappos PEC** - genuine human moment

**Example:**
```
Hi Taylor,

I completely understand the frustration - having this break right before a deadline is the worst timing. [HEARD - empathize]

I'm sorry this happened. Let me get you sorted out. [HEARD - apologize]

Just to make sure I'm solving the right thing - when you say the export failed, did it give an error message, or did it just never complete? [APPLE - probe]

[After response]

Got it. I've fixed the underlying issue and re-ran your export - it should be in your inbox now. I also noticed your account was set to the old export format, so I updated that to prevent similar issues. [HEARD - resolve / Ritz - anticipate]

I'm flagging this for our team since the error message wasn't clear enough - that should have told you exactly what was wrong. [HEARD - diagnose]

P.S. I saw you're presenting at the RE Tech Summit next month - good luck! We'll be cheering for you. [Zappos - PEC]

Let me know if anything else comes up!
```

## Daily Practice

Before each response, pick one framework element to apply consciously:
- Monday: HEARD (service recovery focus)
- Tuesday: Ritz anticipation (predict next question)
- Wednesday: Zappos PEC (genuine connection)
- Thursday: APPLE structure (methodical problem-solving)
- Friday: Combine them all (full framework integration)

Over time, these become instinct rather than checklist.
